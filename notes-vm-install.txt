Oracle requires a Virtual Box VM image for the lab environment. They supply a starter one. In addition to that, I installed

Eclipse 64 bit Oxygen
- pointed workspace preferences to JDK instead of JRE
- created workspace
- set workspace to open by default
- connected workspace to this repo
- pulled in two Maven projects from this repo
- installed JUnit 5 update/support for Oxygen
- ran Maven build to ensure works (and so all/most required dependencies are cached in local repository)
- deleted solutions project so not in workspace

IntelliJ Community Edition (64 bit)
- imported lab project from git local directory (created by eclipse) and configured using same JDK as configured for Eclipse
- ran junit tests
- ran maven build
(this doesnâ€™t let you pull from within IntellIJ. Which is fine because can pull on command line in one place for any editor)

Git Bash
- default install

Maven 3.5.0
- unzipped under c:\users\lab
- added c:\users\lab\apache-maven-3.5.0\bin to user path environment variable
- delete entry from local repo and ran build at command line to ensure worked

Edge browsers
- open this repository and junit 5 guide in tabs
- pin each to start menu as tiles
- set these two tabs to home page for Edge
